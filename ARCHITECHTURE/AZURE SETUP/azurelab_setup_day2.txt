# azure-red-team Lab Day 2

## ARCHITECTURE Step 2:

**Description:** This is an architectural overview of  a Red-Team demo cloud infrastructure that includes a jump-box and 4 servers running containers that feed logs to a machine running ELK stack.

- [X] Docker is installed and running on the Jump-box.
- [X] The cyberxsecurity/ansible Docker container is running on the jump-box.
- [X] The security group has a rule that allows the jump-box ssh access to the vNet.
- [X] An ssh key created from inside the Ansible container that has no password.
- [X] The Web VMs password has been reset using the ssh key from the Ansible container.
- [X] Ansible is able to make a connection to both Web VMs.
