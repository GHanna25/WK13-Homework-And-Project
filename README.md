I have installed the following programs on these machines.

- Filebeat and Metricbeat

- Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that centralizes log data. It also monitors log files, collects log events, and will forward them to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

- Metricbeat collects data metrics from the OS and other services that are running. It then takes the stats it collects and ships them to whichever output you specify.
