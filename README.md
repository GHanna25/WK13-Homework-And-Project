I have installed the following programs on these machines.

- Filebeat and Metricbeat

- Filebeat is a lightweight shipper that centralizes log data. It also monitors log files, collects log events, and will forward them to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

- Metricbeat collects data metrics from the OS and other services that are running. It then takes the stats it collects and ships them to whichever output you specify.


The scripts and files used to install these programs and architecture are listed below
